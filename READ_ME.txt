I have used two set of files for the final output of using the data to analyse the research study using the DML and to clean the data using Stata.

1. first run the file final_stata_code.do which will be helpful to create the data used for the analysis and also, it will create the regression output table for the research study using the OLS.
	it will also import the data into csv format to be utilise by the R.
2. Run the final_code file for the reference of the further cleaning and selection of variables based on the research study whch will create the result output for the OLS linear and multi linear regression output along with the DID estimation.
	Furthermore I run the DML on this data and it will also gives the DML fit results for the research question.
